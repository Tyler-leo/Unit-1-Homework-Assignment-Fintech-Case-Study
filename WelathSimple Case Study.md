## Business Activities

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?
  
  
   The main financial problem they are trying to solve is the barrier to entry for beginning or occasional investors. Most first time investors are either intimidated by the market, or don't have enough capital to even get a reputable fund manager to consider taking on their portfolio.  _WealthSimple_ address's both of these barriers to entry.  
   
   The first paragraph of their mission statement is as follows. "Wealthsimple is on a mission to help everyone achieve financial freedom by providing products and advice that are accessible and affordable. We take financial services that are often confusing, opaque, and expensive and make them simple, transparent, and low-cost."
   
    The company has intentionally included their main goal in their Name "_Wealthsimple_". The main target of the company is to make investing, and managing wealth easier for everyone, not just for the select few.  _WealthSimple_ is striving to remove real and perceived barriers of entry into the markets, by providing intuitive financial products with as little as $1.00 to start an account.   

   The main reason Michael Katchen founded the company was to help his colleges, at the time , with a simple but smart spreadsheet to help them increase their returns without the burden of financial management fees.   The companies vision has not changed since its inception, however the scale of dollars under management, and Robo-advisor technology has advanced significancy.  

* Who is the company's intended customer? Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?

The intended target market would be Millennial focused ("people born between 1981 to 1996" [Source millennials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennials)), more specifically professional millennial types with a passive investment style.  They have created a sleek, clean modern design that has attracted  this segment of the market, who want to "park" their money into a well researched investment product that will bring them steady returns.  

_WealthSimple_ is targeting passive investors who are looking for reasonable and consistent return.  Most of their products are based on index funds, or ETF's that reduce the overall risk by spreading their capital across multiple companies. They have a focus of managing customers RRSP's, RESP'S and TFSA's - with most companies switching their pension funds to self directed, this opens up a large market for _WealthSimple_ to acquire. They have eliminated fees for the the first $5,000.00 invested, hoping to attract Millennial Canadians who haven't started their investment journey yet.

Millennials in Canada make up 1/4 of the population, and are the largest segment in the labour force.  The currently hold over $824 billiton in assets.  With 4 in 5 saving and only 1 in 2 investing - the potentially for growth in our market it substantial.

*  What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (what is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

Their main competitor's in Canada are larger banks and smaller discount brokerages.  The main competitive advantage is how simple the platform is to use.  The stigma behind banks, and discount brokerages, is how difficult or how much knowledge you need to start an account, and handle it basically on your own. _WealthSimple_ has positioned itself as an easy to use, if not fun platform for people to start using with little or no knowledge to start out. They also have multiple teaching tools to help people educate themselves on the platform with regards to investing.  They have numerous articles, and a exceptional customer service team that can quickly help and implement their financial products.  Not only does the service team help you set everything up, they are willing to take the time to explain what the products are, and why you would want to use them specifically.  The website and mobile app have been purposely designed for a "simple" and easy user experience.  The "big banks", and majority of discount banks currently don't have this advantage. Banking apps are getting better, however they are still more complex and less user friendly than the  _WealthSimple_ app.

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? 
  * WealthSImple uses 30 Technology products ([Source: Crunchbase](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/wealthsimple/technology)) an example of some of the products include:
   
    * **Rails Engines** - previous system used for depositing funds and moving assets was the *Ruby on Rails* service.  "This system was developed and piecemeal over several years with multiple major feathers added in close succession.  For our Rapidly growing number of clients, everything was running smoothly.  Under the hood, however, we sensed things were starting to get a little complicated." ([Source:Tidying up with Wealthsimple](https://medium.com/wealthsimple/tidying-up-with-wealthsimple-355d006ea70c))  The solution was "Rails Engines", the application acted like a "supercharged" engine, simplifying the complications "under the hood".  Allowing customer transactions to not be interrupted as the company scaled and grew at a fast pace.
    * **Kafka** - This is a distributed streaming platform used to publish and subscribe streams of records.  The old platform "environment was a multi-tenant cluster and had limits on partitions and throughput that we knew wouldn't scale with our needs." with higher  customer demands they had to upgrade their platform to scale the system to meet these needs.  Kafka was migration took place 2021. ([Source: New Kafka Tier, No Kafka Tears
    ](https://medium.com/wealthsimple/new-kafka-tier-no-kafka-tears-95b1cbe7d15c))
    * **Typescript** - is programming language used to develop Javascript. _WealthSimple_ switched from the flow program language.  "Pain points with grew with Flow, it became clear that we would need to migrate."  *Typescript* provided more third party libraries, and is more user friendly. "*Typescript*, it seemed like fixing these errors manually, all 3,000 of them in just one of our services." ([Source: Migrating to TypeSCript without Migraines](https://medium.com/wealthsimple/migrating-to-typescript-without-migraines-845613cd7ded))
    * **Security Tech: 256-bit SSL Certificate** -this is a technology that encrypts and decrypts a 256 bit key that is transferred between the client and the server. _WealthSimple_ uses this technology on their web servers between their customers web browsers to encrypt and safely transfer important data ([Source: How does Wealth simple handle security and encryption?](https://www.wealthsimple.com/en-ca/learn/security-encryption#:~:text=Encryption%3A%20We%20use%20state%20of,including%20passwords%20and%20personal%20information.))
    * **Jquerry** - " A well-written Javascript code", used for the webpage for easy front end development. ([Source: Educba](https://www.educba.com/what-is-jquery/))
 

## Landscapes

* What domain of the financial industry is the company in?

_WealthSimple_, as a Company, crosses many domains e.g open banking, wealth management ect.. however the main domain the company is in would be **Robo-Advising**, which was what the company was originally founded to do. 

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?

Over the last 5-10 years there has been a cultural shift with customers not wanting to interact with people at business's.  Rather than calling directly and talking with someone at a business, customers would rather ask on the website, send in a ticket or email to get their answers for their inquiries.  This has been a major advantage in progression for the domain of Robo-Advising.  People are getting more and more comfortable allowing their investments for retirement, schooling, homes ect.. to be handled by 

In the last 5-10 years more and more companies have switched their pensions to a "self directed pension plan".  Essentially these pension funds puts you in control of your investments for retirement.  Most people that invest are passive vs active investors - Robo-Advising has been an ideal solutions for passive investors.  This product, as discussed earlier, allows investors to answer a few simple questions to assess their investment styles and individual risk tolerances.  The product in turn invests and diversifies the customers portfolio, with the overall goal to balance the risk and returns that the clients are comfortable with.

Customers are becoming more aware of how fee's are eating away from their overall returns.  Allot of mutual funds or investment managers charge front-end , bank-end, and ongoing fees that eat away at a customers returns over the investments life span.  Robo-Advising reduces this fees substantially, they tend to invest into Index funds and ETF's which subsequently reduces the overall fees.  In basic terms Rob-Advising allows a customer to essentially "cut out the middle man".

The younger demographics that are growing up are becoming more and more comfortable with technology. Generation Z, born after 1996, "utilize handheld communication devices and accessories to communicate. In fact they're on messaging apps 57% of the time they are using their smartphones"([Source Quote - Generational Marketing: How Each Generation Has Adapted and Utilizes Technology](https://martech.zone/generation-technology/)).  The majority of customers are becoming more savvy with technology, and more willing to try new forms of customers service and experiences.  15-20 years ago customers would be more resistant to technology, and more willing to talk to advisors over the phone or in person.

 ## Results

 * What has been the business impact of this company so far?

 _WealthSimple_ has proven itself to be a large competitor in the *Robo-Advising* domain, attracting new investors at a substantial rate. As a result of the pandemic, the industry has seen a rapid growth in customers wanting to exit high priced mutual and management run funds.  In 2020 alone "Wealth simple already saw an increase in new investors by 24%" ([Source Wealthsimple Inc Swot & Pestle Analysis](https://www.swotandpestle.com/wealthsimple-inc/#:~:text=The%20mission%20statement%20of%20Wealthsimple%20reads%2C%20%22Our%20mission,financial%20products%20for%20everyone%22.%20Wealthsimple%20Inc.%20Revenue%20%3A)). 2021 saw the company valued at $5 billion during an investment round, which attracted celebrities like Micheal J Fox, Drake, and Ryan Reynolds.  

In January of 2021 _WealthSimple_ was ranked as the number one app on the Canadian apple App store, and remained in the top 10 until march 2021([Source Wealthsimple Trade in-depth review](https://www.moneysense.ca/save/investing/wealthsimple-trade-review/)).  Since its initial inception with less than 1,000 users, _WealthSimple_ has grown to over 1.4 million users.  The impact on the industry, has been substantially in the last 8 years.  In the period of 2020 to 2021 _WealthSimple saw a user growth of 1,000%.  During the first half of 2020, 18% of all brokerage accounts were _WealthSImple_ accounts ([Source: Insider intelligence](https://www.emarketer.com/content/wealthsimple-secures-another-mega-raise-3-7b-valuation))  With monthly app downloads in the last 30 days of **189,867 apps** and **4,937,319 website views**, the company is poised to continue to grow ([Source: Crunchbaase](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/wealthsimple/technology)).

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success?  Howe is you company performing, based on these metrics?

The main or core metric the financial *Robo-Advisor* domain would use as a performance tool would be Assets under management and number of users. Please see table below for metric breakdown of major competitors:


|   Company   |   Assets Under Management   |  Users  
| --- | --- | ----|
WealthSimple   |   $15 billion   | 1.4 Million
M1 Finance   |   $6 billion   |  500 000
Ellevest | $1 billion | 120,000 
Personal Capital | $21.9 billion | 800,000
Robinhood Financial | NA | 31 Million
Wealthfront Inc. | $4.6  billion | 100,000

Comparing the metrics _WealthSimple_ has a healthy AUM when compared with competitors, however there is room for growth in the U.S market.  As noted by the amount of users on the Robinhood Financial platform, there are opportunities to expand and grab market share towards their platform. [Source: Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page).

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?

When comparing current market allocation with regards to users and assets under management, _Wealthsimple_ is one of the top performers when comparing the data.  This is promising, there is roof to grow and they have give "proof of concept" that their current business model is working.  After analyzing data across competitors in our Canadian market, _WealthSImple_ is competing with U.S companies in a much larger market space.  The competitors in the U.S do have the advantage of larger population and customer base - however in this domain there really are no borders anymore.   _WealthSImple_ has focused on the Canadian market and still has been successfully competing with its counterparts in the states.  The future looks bright, there is a hugh opportunity in the U.S and worldwide larger market place, _WealthSimple_ has the right  position to exponentially expand its customer base and AUM in the near future.

## Recommendations 

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or  use your imagination!)

If I were to advise on a new product line for _WealthSimple_, 2 new products come to mind:

1.  Cryptocurrency Exchange - you can buy crypto currency on _WealthSimple_, but with more and more customers who want to swap one Crypto for another straight across like a currency exchange -they would have to go to a company like [Uniswap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniswap) .  Uniswap facilitates exchanging one Crypto currency for another at todays market rates, they take a fee for the exchange.  This is a largely untapped market, and would be a great way to generate cash flow for the company.  Because the technology is already essentially in place this would be the easiest product to implement and expand their product line.

2. Loans and mortgage - [Rocket mortgages](https://www.rocketmortgage.com/?redirect=true&croRedirect=RmSitecoreControl&adobe_mc_sdid=SDID%3D7E2D03A094B2E02F-2B1FBCCA8030782F%7CMCORGID%3D5D60123F5245B13E0A490D45@AdobeOrg%7CTS%3D1653871204&adobe_mc_ref=https:%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F) from quicken have already proven the concept.  Defi Mortgages have proven to be profitable,  Rocket Mortgages generated $12.9 billion in revenue in the period of 2021.  With competitors such as Sofi and Prosper getting into the space, there is an opportunity to get in early and grab "Early Majority" in the Canadian market.  _WealthSImple_ is already a trusted space for Canadians to invest their money, why not make it one stop shop for all your financial product needs.

*Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

I believe, that in both of the products stated above, you have a existing proof of concept. With the trust and customer validation that _WealthSimple_ has built over the years, they could put this good will to use and help customers with even more financial product.  The main benefit to the company would be the cash flow from these products, the company already has the assets to set up the Defi accounts.  With proper risk management with regards to customer loans and approvals, the mortgage and loan product would be an instant cash generator.  

The Cryptocurrency exchange would take a large upfront cost\ to build the program and coding necessary to facilitate the product.  Also you would have to generate a pool of Crypto assets to perform the swaps, but after the initial investment - once the swap and pool is in place you would need a team for maintenance.  From then on your product would be cash flowing and generating profit for your investors.


* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

The Crypto Exchange would utilize smart contracts thru Blockchain technology, which would be based on the Solidity object programming language.  Crypto based SSH keys to ensure security would also need to be established.  _WealthSimple_ already utilizes this technology, and is the space of security storing and transforming data, so this should be easy to implement.

With regards to the loans and mortgage, similar Blockchain based smart contracts would need to be created to ensure contracts are executed properly.  With smart contacts being a form of a "safe vending machine", the customer and _WealthSImple_ would both have the assurance that loans and mortgages would not be executable until all conditions are met in the contracts.  Once the conditions are met the contracts(loans/titles) are released - this will allow for a more secure and hassle free process for both the customer and the business.  Essentially a "Win WIn".

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?

As previously stated, Smart contract technology delivered thru solidity based programming, would be a trusted and proven method to facilitate the above products for _WealthSimple_.   The blockchain technology would guarantee the accuracy of the contracts performed and the documentation would be available to the authorized nodes to scrutinize the and document the transactions.  

With the advantage of this technology we can ensure the accuracy, proper execution and cost saving efficiency of these new products.
